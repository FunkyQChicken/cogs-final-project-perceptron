# Running
To run just use 

```bash
python3 main.py
```

the results function in the main file isn't called,
but it is needed if you want to re-generate the 
figures seen in the table in the paper.

Right now the main will just generate images of 
each kind of perceptron for each number.

# Requirements
* Python 3
* numpy
